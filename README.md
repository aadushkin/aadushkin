- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex.
- 👀 I’ve coded years ago and now my plan is to actualize my skills. 
- 🌱 I think it'll be Py, JS and Swift... but who knows. Anyway initially I'll play around with some ideas.
- 💞️ Not sure I can help nor need any help now...
- 📫 ... but you can reach me here or via my gmail which is quite obvious.
